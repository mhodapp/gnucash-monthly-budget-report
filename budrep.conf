# If the first non-blank character in a line is a # character that line is ignored.

# Blank lines are ignored.

# Data lines contain a keyword and a parameter. 
# Spaces may precede and follow the keyword and its parameter.
# An = character must separate the keyword and the parameter.
# A # after the parameter and any following characters are ignored. 
#
# Valid keywords are:
#	budget_year
#	GNUCash_file
#	report_file
#	map_account
#       ignore_account
#
# Except for the map_account and ignore_account keywords, each line may contain only
#     1 keyword/parameter(s) combination.
#     The same keyword may be specified in multiple lines; except for the 
#     ignore_account keyword, only the last occurrence is used.
#
# The budget_year must be the 4 digit year, e.g., 2009, but no test is performed.
#
# The GNUCash_file is the compressed .xml file used by GNUCash.
#     Any month's budget report can be created/recreated as long as the data for 
#     all months up to and including the report month is in the file.
# 
# The report_file parameter is extended by .YYYYMM.txt where YYYY is the budget_year and
#     MM is the report month requested.
#
# The map_account keyword allows 2 parameters separated by a greater_than symbol (>).
#     The first parameter is the full account name used in the GNUCash application;
#     the qualification levels are separated by colons (:). A list of Expenses and 
#     Income accounts suitable for use as the first parameter of the map_account 
#     keyword can be listed by specifying the --list optional parameter when running
#     the budget report program.
#     The second parameter is the description of the account to be printed in the 
#     budget report. This should make the budget report more readable without the
#     sometimes large fully qualified, colon separated account names. However the 
#     fully qualified name will be used if the second parameter is not specified.
#     If the description is Do_Not_Print, than the account will not be output to the 
#     report_file and the account's values will not appear in the subtotals or totals;
#     if no ignore_account keyword/parameter is supplied for the account, and the
#     account has non-zero amounts, a message will be output to STDOUT.
#     
# The ignore_account keyword allows suppression of messages about non-zero amounts for
#     accounts not desired in the report_file.
#     Multiple ignore_account lines are supported.
#     Multiple accounts, separated by space(s), are supported on each ignore_account line.
